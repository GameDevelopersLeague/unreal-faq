Where do I get started learning Unreal?
https://learn.unrealengine.com/

I'm a programmer and I want to get started, what should I do?
I'd recommend spending some time in Blueprints. That way you learn the UE4 API (as BP is just exposed C++ API), why and how to use them as they will be a big part of your workflow (for the better I can assure you).

But here are some additional handy links to go along side the learning site:
